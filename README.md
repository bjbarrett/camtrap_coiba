## Agouti output
Agouti output can be cleaned using the "agouti_cleaning.R" script. Currently this aims to extract whether a capuchin occurred in the sequence yes or no, and the count of capuchins. 
This script is now also used to look at the effect of the tides on movement. For this, run the "tide_cleaning.R" script  from the cebaco_island_tide_charts folder first, and then the agouti_cleaning.R script without clearing your R workspace.
